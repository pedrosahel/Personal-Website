                <h3>Web</h3>
                <p> <a href="https://github.com/pedrosahel/MaratonaExplorer">Arataka Reigen Responde</a> is an entertainment website that answers questions using a repository of premade answers. The site is in Portuguese, my native language, and is based on a character of a show called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_Psycho_100">Mob Psycho 100</a> </p>

                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>I made this <a href="https://github.com/pedrosahel/MixItUp">game</a> in a 2022 gamejam which the theme was "Mix it up". I did all the programming and a huge friend of mine, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucasmanja/">Lucas Manja</a>, did all the art. Our intentions was to make a game to help children understand the primary and secondary colors by mixing them.</p>

            <img class="city-img" src="imgs/fortaleza.png" alt="fortaleza-city-img">
            <P>Fortaleza  is the state capital of Ceará, located in Northeastern Brazil. It is Brazil's 5th largest city, with a population of slightly over 2.7 million. Fortaleza's coastline is 34km(21 miles) long, with a total of fifteen beaches. Even knowing that probably there's a lot of places like this in the world, I know for a fact that there's no place like this in the world.</P>

                <h3>Books</h3>
                <p>Last year I read so little, that I was ashamed of myself, so this year's resolutions was to get back on my feet and read as much as possible. You can check how this is going <a href="">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>This right here is my ultimate passion. But it seems that no matter how much time I have, I'd probably never finish my waiting list of games to play. But despite of that, I'm playing a lot of games this year, and if I find the right amount of williness I'll be posting some opinions right <a href="">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Movies, TV Shows & Animes</h3>
                <p>When it comes to movies, I'm all about the old ones. But TV shows? The last few years whe had so many good shows that is hard to keep track of them in all media. A LOT of adaptation of awesome books, and also a lot of fantasy, witch is my favorite genre. I'm always watching something that matches my humor.</p>

                <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. There's a variation of that called Beach Volleyball, where two teams of two or four players compete on a sand court. Where I live, Beach Volleyball is really popular an it is a ton of fun to play.</p>
